To contribute to this website you can:

* Use GitHub, by accessing the repository at this [link](https://github.com/gabrielepujatti/ETE_notes)

* Let me know via email at `gabriele.pujatti@ut-capitole.fr`


### Some additional information

To add a new topic, create a folder in the appropriate folder, then go to `first_semester/first_semester.yml` and add the link and label under the appropriate section.

Right now, only [Katex](https://katex.org/) is supported (the default on Quarto), but in case more functionalities are needed more complete (but cumbersome) latex implementations can be used
