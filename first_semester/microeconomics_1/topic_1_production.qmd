{{< include //tex_definitions.qmd >}}

This chapter is about production units (i.e. firms), focusing on what they *can do* (the production set) and how they do it *maximizing profits*.

Production vector
: is a vector $y \in \R^L$, where L is the total number of goods in the economy. It includes both the inputs and the outputs of a transformation process.

By convention, in the production vector negative numbers represent inputs and positive are outputs. Zeros are used for goods that are not concerned in the production process.

::: {.callout-note}
Goods are defined in a time and place, so for example transporting an apple for turin to toulouse would mean using a vehicle and an apple in turin as input and and getting a vehicle and an apple in toulouse as an output.

Production set
: is the set of all the production vectors that are technologically feasible. The notation is $Y \subset \R^L$.

Any $y$ that belongs to $Y$ is feasible, while those that don't belong to the production set are not.

Transformation function
: A function $F(\cdot)$ is useful to describe the production set.

Marginar Rate of Transformation
: For two commodities $l$ and $k$ in a production vector $\bar y$ that satisfies $F(\bar y) = 0$ (that means that the vector is on the transformation frontier) is defined as:

$$
MRT_{lk}(\bar{y}) = \frac{\partial F(\bar{y})/\partial y_l}{\partial F(\bar{y})/\partial y_k}
$$

This holds when $F(\cdot)$ is differentiable at $\bar y$. This tells you how much more of good $l$ you can produce by giving up an extra unit of good $k$.
